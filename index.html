                                    <p class="padBot5"><span>I graduated from Sparks High School, from BYU with a Bachelor of Arts,  and from J. Clark Law School as a Jurisdoctor, all with honors, plus I earned a teaching certificate from the University of Nevada.  I taught school in  Reno and Sparks and I served in the National Guard. <br/><br/> I have been successfully practicing law in Las Vegas for 40 years, making me the most  experienced attorney in this race. My practice includes criminal law, personal injury law (plaintiff and defense), family law, business law, HOA law, and agency law, to name a few.  I am experienced in a dealing with state and federal bureaucracies, having argued before various agencies, including cases involving NDOT, OSHA, the Nevada Dept. of Taxation, the IRS, and the BLM. I have conducted numerous jury trials, including criminal and civil cases in state and federal courts. I have argued before the Nevada Supreme Court and the 9th Circuit. I have appeared in almost every county courthouse in Nevada. I have also tried cases in Arizona, Florida, Ohio, and in West Virginia, and I am admitted to practice before the US Tax Court, the 4th and 11th Federal Circuit Courts of Appeal, plus the US Supreme Court.  I received the preeminent AV rating from Martindale Hubbell, meaning excellence in ability and ethics. I managed my own law office for many years, and then became a partner in Cooper Levenson, a multi-state firm. <br/><br/> All of this makes me uniquely qualified to be the Attorney General of Nevada, due to my experience in so many diverse areas of law, which will enable me to understand and manage the legal work which the Attorney General's office must carry out. And I can appear personally to represent the State of Nevada in any Court, including the U.S. Supreme Court. </span><span class="extra2"></span></p>

                                    <h2>THE BLM’S BUNDY BLUNDER—PATRIOTS VS. FASCISTS</h2>
                                    <h3 class="textStyle18">By Joel F. Hansen, Chairman, Independent American Party of Nevada</h3>
                                    <p>Cliven Bundy’s ancestors on his mother’s side came, as pioneers, to the Gold Butte area of the southern Nevada desert in 1877 and began ranching from scratch. In doing this they established grazing rights and water rights—preemptive legal rights under Nevada law which gave them permanent rights to graze cattle on that land. Those legal rights were passed down through the years to Cliven Bundy and his family.  In 1934, the Taylor Grazing Act was passed by Congress, an act designed to assist ranchers, especially in the arid American West, to raise cattle for the benefit Americans—by putting delicious and nutritious beef on their tables.   The Bundy ranch is located about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas, near the town of Bunkerville.</p>
                                    <p>These pioneers conquered this hostile, arid land and made it into a productive ranch by making water and feed available to their cattle and learning how to manage the cows so that they could survive in such an arid place, an area mostly covered by sagebrush and creosote bushes.  Because of the water and increased food made available by the ranchers’ efforts, wildlife flourished.  The most numerous animal wildlife in the area is the desert tortoise. The tortoises flourished because the cows eat woody bushes which are above the level the tortoises can reach, and then they leave a delicacy for the tortoises on the ground where they can reach it.  The tortoises’ main course and dessert is cow pies, which contain all of the nutrients and moisture the tortoises need for survival.</p>
                                    <!-- <h3 class="textStyle18">Aliquam a odio aorbi a dignissim nisan aliquet magna in nulla congue vehicula</h3> -->
                                    <p>In 1946, the Bureau of Land Management was created by Congress with the mission of helping ranchers to succeed by helping them construct watering facilities, fences, and other things needed by cattle and by ranchers.  The partnership was a good one, and Cliven Bundy paid the grazing fees required by the BLM for many years.  The people who ran the BLM in the beginning were rancher friendly, having degrees in solid scientific areas like geology, range management, animal husbandry, and the like.  But beginning in the 1970’s and growing in numbers at an ever increasing rate each year was a new generation of BLM-ocrats, those with degrees in the “environmental sciences.”  This new generation saw ranchers not as fellow citizens cooperating in the effort to make the land productive, but as enemies who were destroying the environment.   They had signs on their walls—“no more moo by 92” and “cattle free by 93.” As a result, in an effort to eliminate ranching in Nevada, the BLM began raising the annual fee for each cow on the range (AUM’s) and shortening the grazing season. Thus, out of over 50 ranchers in Clark County, only Cliven Bundy survived, as one by one all of his fellow ranchers gave up and went out of business because they couldn’t make a profit under the BLM’s oppressive rules. </p>
                                    <p>But Cliven knew that the BLM was supposed to be his servant, not his master, and so, since his servant was trying to destroy him, he famously “fired” the BLM and told them he did not need their services anymore and to stay off his ranch.  The BLM didn’t take too kindly to that, and so it obtained two federal court orders that rancher Bundy had to pay the grazing fees or clear out.  Cliven responded that he would do “whatever it takes” to preserve his family’s ancestral rights in the land, rights which had existed for many years before the BLM was created.  He took the position that neither the BLM nor the federal court had any jurisdiction over that land, because it belongs to the State of Nevada.</p>

                                    <p>To understand this claim, one must understand that when the Territory of Nevada came into the Union, all of the unappropriated land in the Territory had belonged to the federal government under the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Mexico. Under the Northwest Ordinance, passed before the US Constitution was adopted, and continued by later Congresses, as new states came into the Union, all of the federally owned land in each state was to be turned over to the State, or to the people by sale.  The philosophy was that each state should enter the union on an “equal footing” with all of the older states, none of which had federal land of any appreciable amount within their boundaries.  And so it is that East of the Rocky Mountains there is almost no federally owned land in any of the states. But the philosophy changed out West.  As the new states of Colorado, Idaho, Utah, New Mexico, Nevada, and 8 other western states came into the Union, Congress required the Territorial Legislatures to renounce any claim they had to the unappropriated lands within their borders.  And so it is that on average, 50% of the land in these 13 Western states is claimed by the federal government, Nevada having the greatest percentage of federally claimed land, almost 90%.</p>
                                    <p>But then in the 1970’s and 80’s there arose the “Sagebrush Rebellion” among the western people, vociferously arguing that they wanted no more to be treated as territories of the federal government, but as full-fledged states.  Westerners had long complained that Federal control had weakened these states’ economies and stifled economic growth long enough.  The spark that turned these complaints into a "rebellion" was the enactment in 1976 of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Land_Policy_and_Management_Act" target="_blank">Federal Land Policy and Management Act</a> (FLPMA) that ended <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homestead_Acts" target="_blank">homesteading</a>, which meant that the federal government would forever retain control of western public lands.  </p>

                                    <p>Sagebrush Rebels wanted the federal government to give more control of federally “owned” western lands to state and local authorities. This was meant to increase the growth of western economies. Republican <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Reagan" target="_blank">Ronald Reagan</a> declared himself a sagebrush rebel in an August 1980 campaign speech in Salt Lake City, telling the crowd, "I happen to be one who cheers and supports the Sagebrush Rebellion. Count me in as a rebel."  Nevada led the way.  The "Sagebrush Rebellion" burst onto the Western scene in 1979, when the Nevada legislature enacted a law claiming ownership of the "unappropriated" public lands in the state.</p>
                                    <p>And so when Cliven Bundy says he doesn’t recognize federal jurisdiction over his ranch, he points to the State of Nevada laws which say that Nevada owns the land under his ranch and he owns the grazing and water rights.  After he fired the BLM, Cliven paid his next bill for grazing fees to Clark County, which accepted his payment, in fact he paid several times, but then, not knowing what to do with the money, the county refunded it.  And so Cliven began putting these fees into a trust account.</p>
                                    <p>Finally, a federal judge ordered the BLM to impound and remove all of Bundy’s cattle.  When sympathetic ranchers and other patriotic Americans around the country heard of this pending federal invasion of the Bundy ranch, the anger simmering throughout the West against federal bureaucratic high handedness reached a boiling point.  People gathered in large numbers on the ranch to protest the BLM’s threatened invasion. These patriotic cowboys and “militia” (which is defined in the U.S. code as all able bodied men between the ages of 17 and 45) were there to exercise their First Amendment right to peaceably assemble and their Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.  But the BLM moved in anyway, and committed atrocities in the process.  When Davey Bundy tried to video federal agents preparing the invasion, he was thrown to the ground, his iPad was confiscated, he was stomped on the neck and his face was ground into the rocks and dirt, after which he was transported to Las Vegas, held many hours with his hands handcuffed behind his back, and was later released with no charges filed and the record of his stay in the jail erased. One of the Bundy women, Aunt Margaret, was violently thrown to the ground, and Ammon Bundy was tazed. Numerous cattle were shot, and many were secretly buried in a shallow grave.  The Feds set up a couple of “1st amendment zones,” small enclosed areas in which any protestors were supposed to confine their activities.  (The Bundy’s aptly named these “pig pens.”) This anti-Constitutional action brought forth a firestorm of protests from people of all stations, including the governor of Nevada.  The BLM was forced by public opinion to remove these ridiculous “1stamendment zones.”  But worst of all, the BLM brought in professional mercenaries, protected by body armor and armed to the teeth with military style firearms, who had specific assignments to shoot certain people immediately if violence broke out.  They proceeded to round up the Bundy cattle, scaring them half to death with helicopters and hired cowboys, and fenced them in a dry gully located partially under an I-15 bridge. </p>
                                    <p>About 200 cowboys and others dressed in camouflage walked down the dry gulch, some on horses, some with handguns holstered cowboy fashion on their hips.  There is no evidence that any of these people ever pointed a gun at the BLM and their FBI friends who were present, despite mountains of video evidence of every moment of the stand-off.  Although there is one famous photo of one protestor pointing a rifle through a space in the barricades on top of the bridge, there is no evidence that he pointed it at anyone nor that any of the BLM invaders saw the muzzle of his rifle.  In the face of determined patriots and volunteer militia men on the other side of the cattle fence and the Clark County sheriff who pleaded with the BLM to disperse in order to prevent violence, the cowardly feds turned tail and ran. </p>
                                    <p>Over a year later, Cliven was arrested when he got off a plane in Oregon on his way to visit his sons camped on the Malheur wildlife refuge who were defending the rights of some Oregon ranchers who had been unjustly imprisoned on trumped up charges.  That stand-off, in which one of the Bundy supporters, LaVoy Finicum, was killed in cold blood by an FBI agent, went before a jury. All of the defendants were acquitted. </p>
                                    <p>Instead of the government releasing Ammon and Ryan, they were transported to Nevada and kept in federal prison with their father, Cliven.  They were held until trial on the false premise that they were a danger to their community and that they were flight risks, all of which was groundless.  Cliven has never had as much as a traffic ticket.  No criminal record.  The trial was run by Judge Gloria Navarro, (appointed on recommendation of Senator Harry Reid) who made outrageous anti-defense pro-prosecution rulings throughout the trial.  She ruled that the First and Second Amendments could not be used as defenses in the trial (pardon us, but isn’t that why the founders put those amendments into the Constitution?!).  And she even kicked one defendant off the stand when he tried to testify that he had seen federal snipers on the buttes overlooking the ranch.  She said he couldn’t testify to this because there was insufficient evidence of snipers being present. (Pardon us again, but wouldn’t his testimony have supplied that evidence?!)</p>
                                    <p>The prosecution of the case in Las Vegas was headed by US Attorney Steve Myrhe, while the invasion itself had been directed by Dan Love of the BLM. These two worked together to hide key evidence from the Defense team.  The defense lawyers kept insisting that the government was hiding exculpatory surveillance evidence and other key documents.  Myrhe and Love kept denying that.  </p>
                                    <p>Then, in answer to the many prayers of the Bundy family and many others, the prosecution’s case was broken wide open.  Judge Navarro, based upon indisputable evidence presented to her by the defense attorneys, finally ordered the prosecutors to turn over exculpatory documents, the existence of which Steve Myhre had been denying all along.  And then, to make matters worse for the Prosecution, Larry Wooten, a former BLM investigator who worked on the Bundy case, filed a <a href="https://redoubtnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Larry-Wooten-Communication_77PI.pdf" target="_blank">whistleblower complaint</a> with the Justice Department, alleging that he’d been removed from the investigation in February after he’d raised concerns about misconduct by Love. He said that the government had failed to turn over evidence of such misconduct to defense lawyers for the Bundy’s and that BLM officials were biased against the Bundy’s, exposing the facts that during the investigation, “at any given time, you could hear the subjects of this investigation openly referred to as ‘retards,’ ‘red-necks,’ ‘overweight women with the big jowls,’ ‘d*uche bags,’ ‘tractor-face,’ ‘idiots,’ ‘in-bred,’ etc., etc.” Wooten wrote, in a 12 page memo, that during the ranch standoff Love had told agents to “kick Cliven Bundy in the mouth (or teeth) and take his cattle.”</p>
                                    <p>Wooten reported that BLM officers had bragged about using excessive force during the arrest of Dave Bundy in 2014 and “grinding his face into the ground.”  More significant for the prosecution, Wooten wrote that on multiple occasions, Love “specifically and purposely ignored  orders in order to command the most intrusive, oppressive, large-scale, and militaristic trespass cattle impound possible.”  He added, “The investigation indicated that there was little doubt there was an improper cover-up in virtually every matter that [Love] participated in or oversaw, and that [Love] was immune from discipline and the consequences of his actions.”  Wooten also stated that Steve Myhre knew about the cover up and refused to do anything about it, despite Wooten’s requests.  Thankfully, Dan Love has since been fired and Steve Myrhe has been re-assigned.</p>
                                    <p>The government turned over the Wooten memo to the defense in December, and Cliven Bundy’s lawyer, Brett Whipple, who succeeded Joel Hansen as Cliven’s attorney, immediately used it to ask Navarro to dismiss the case. Judge Navarro at first declared a mistrial, and soon after that, dismissed the case.  In the dismissal hearing, Judge Navarro excoriated the prosecution and the BLM for over a half an hour because of their illegal and egregious actions in deliberately hiding evidence, calling their actions “the worst case of prosecutorial misconduct I have ever seen.”  She said federal prosecutors acted recklessly and engaged in a "deliberate attempt to mislead and distort the truth" by failing to turn over evidence that could have helped exonerate the four defendants.</p>
                                    <p>Cliven Bundy, after 700 days of false imprisonment, walked out of the federal court house a free man on that very day, asking, “Since when did federal bureaucrats have an army to point their guns down the throats of ‘We the People?’ That’s not what the founding fathers intended.  We’re not done with this. If the BLM tries this again, we’ll tell them the truth.  And that’s all we’ve ever done.”  Unfortunately, the BLM and the federal prosecutors can’t say the same about themselves after their dishonest and even criminal conduct was exposed.  Let’s hope all of this helps bring back some honesty and accountability to the federal agencies.  And let’s also hope that this leads to the liberation of state lands now held by the federal bureaucrats against the will of the people of the western states.</p>
                                    <p>Cliven Bundy and his sons are modern American heroes, who fought against tyranny at the peaceful battle of Bunkerville, in memory of the bloody battle against tyranny at Bunker Hill.</p>

                                            Okay, here's the bombshell. The volcanic eruption in Iceland.  Since its
                                            first spewing of volcanic ash, it has, in just FOUR DAYS, NEGATED EVERY SINGLE EFFORT you have made in the past five years to control CO2 emissions on our planet - all of you.  Of course, you know about this evil
                                            carbon dioxide that we are trying to suppress - it's that vital chemical
                                            compound that every plant requires to live and grow and to synthesize into
                                            oxygen for us humans and all animal life.  I know....it's very
                                            disheartening to realize that all of the carbon emission savings you have
                                            accomplished while suffering the inconvenience and expense of driving
                                            Prius hybrids, buying fabric grocery bags, sitting up till midnight to
                                            finish your kids "The Green Revolution" science project, throwing out all
                                            of your non-green cleaning supplies, using only two squares of toilet
                                            paper, putting a brick in your toilet tank reservoir, selling your SUV and
                                            speedboat, vacationing at home instead of abroad, nearly getting hit every
                                            day on your bicycle, replacing all of your 50 cent light bulbs with $10.00
                                            light bulbs.....well, all of those
                                            things you have done have all gone down the tubes in just four days!

                                            yes, FOUR DAYS - by that volcano in Iceland has totally erased
                                            every single effort you have made to reduce the evil beast, carbon. And
                                            there are around 200 active volcanoes on the planet spewing out this crud
                                            at any one time - EVERY DAY.

                                            I don't really want to rain on your parade too much, but I should mention
                                            that when the volcano Mt Pinatubo erupted in the Philippines in 1991, it
                                            spewed out more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than the entire human
                                            race had emitted in all its years on earth.  Yes, folks, Mt Pinatubo was
                                            active for over One year - think about it.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                            Of course, I shouldn't spoil this 'touchy-feely tree-hugging' moment and
                                            mention the effect of natural solar and cosmic activity, and the
                                            well-recognized 800-year global heating and cooling cycle, which keeps
                                            happening despite our completely insignificant efforts to affect climate
                                            change.  And I do wish I had a silver lining to this volcanic ash cloud,
                                            but the fact of the matter is that the wildfire season across the western
                                            USA and Australia this year alone will negate your efforts to reduce
                                            carbon in our world for the next two to three years. And it happens every
                                            year.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                            Just remember that your government just tried to impose a whopping carbon
                                            tax on you, on the basis of the BOGUS 'human-caused' climate-change
                                            scenario.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                            Hey, isn't it interesting how they don't mention 'Global Warming' anymore, but just 'Climate Change.
                                            It's because the planet has COOLED by 0.7 degrees in the past century and these global warming advocates got caught with their pants down.
                                            And, just keep in mind that you might yet have an Emissions Trading Scheme
                                            - that whopping new tax - imposed on you by
                                            your government, that will achieve absolutely nothing except make you poorer.
                                            It won't stop any volcanoes from erupting, that's for sure.
                                    </p>

                                            Joel's comment:  Why do we have to put up with this nonsense about "Climate Change" every day of our lives? We Independent Americans, and all Americans, should understand:  This isn't about  saving the environment.  No, it's about imposing tyrannical control on the people of the United States and of the world so that we can all be reduced to the status of serfs of our masters in the government.  They  want to put us in the chains of taxation and oppressive regulation.  What we need is a Constitutional Revolution to bring the government back under the control of the people.   As Thomas Jefferson said, "In questions of power then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution."

                                    <h2>Family Separation - Purpose of Partisan Political Agenda</h2>

                                    <p>Unfortunately, Fake News is alive and all too well.</p>
                                    <p>This was witnessed in spades this past week as the Fake News media lied through its fangs about the president on immigration.</p>
                                    <p>The Fake Newsies, at least 90% of whom are Democratic Party operatives, waxed hysteria over the separation of Hispanic children from their immigrant parents, i.e. those who entered America illegally through the southern border. </p>
                                    <p>Of course, the blame for all of this was laid at the feet of the president, who was excoriated by his political enemies in Washington D.C. and their apologists and fellow partisans in the Fake News industry for his “zero tolerance” policy. </p>
                                    <p>By now, any remotely honest observer of the political scene should know that the truth is profoundly otherwise than what fake journalists and commentators would have us think.</p>
                                    <p>First, the “separation of families” for which Trump is being blamed is a feature of a policy that was passed by a Democrat-controlled Congress and signed into law back in 2008 by George W. Bush.  This policy was continued throughout Barack Obama’s two terms.  </p>
                                    <p>In fact, many of the emotionally-charged photos of detention facilities circulated by the Fake News media that were designed to convict Trump of heartlessness were taken while Obama was president. </p>
                                    <p>This is one crucial respect in which coverage of this issue reveals itself for the Fake News that it is.  Yet it is certainly not the only respect.</p>
                                    <p>Second, that for a decade—the decade that their fellow partisans held control of the levers of power in D.C.—fake journalists didn’t utter a peep about this policy for which they are now blasting Trump proves that they are cooking a controversy for partisan political purposes. </p>
                                    <p>This isn’t journalism. It is advocacy. It is political.</p>
                                    <p>It is fake.</p>
                                    <p>Third, the vast majority of those crying over the “separation of families” have spent decades undermining the sanctity of the family at every conceivable turn.  The idea of “traditional family values” is one upon which this crew has set its sights with a vengeance.  They have not only mocked and ridiculed all things religious (and, particularly, Christian), they have aggressively sought to fundamentally transform the entire cultural and legal landscape.</p>
                                    <p>Those who have just now discovered the sanctity of the family—and make no mistakes, when they shed their tears (however fake, like their news, these tears undoubtedly are), they imply their recognition of this spiritual and moral reality—have campaigned inexhaustibly for such family-crippling things as: no-fault divorce; de-stigmatizing both co-habitation outside of marriage and illegitimacy; sexual promiscuity; free contraceptives; the empowerment of the State (Child Protective Services) to remove children from their parents, i.e. to “separate families”; the empowerment of children to divorce their parents; the elevation of homosexuality as something to be celebrated as a viable alternative to heterosexuality; and so-called “same-sex marriage.”</p>
                                    <p>Most importantly, these same people who are now crying over children being separated from their parents have been championing the “right” of mothers to kill the children in their wombs, children who, at that stage in their development, literally have no one to sustain them but their mothers. </p>
                                    <p>Fourth, as President Trump said three years ago when he announced his bid for the presidency, some of those crossing our southern border are bad people.   Border agents, among the bravest and most patriotic of Americans (and many of whom happen to be Hispanic), have readily attested to the truth of Trump’s statement.  </p>
                                    <p>People who resolve to undermine a nation’s sovereignty by breaking its most fundamental of laws are willing to do virtually anything else to fulfill their desires.  It is understandable that they should want to leave their home countries and come to America so as to provide a better life for themselves and their families. But unless it is morally permissible for one’s personal happiness to be purchased at any and all costs—unless the ends always justify the means—this doesn’t change the fact that such people disrespect America and her citizens when they invade our country. </p>
                                    <p>The point, here, is that these people have also sent their children—some as young as four years-old—across multiple countries, in some cases, and extremely dangerous terrain just so that they can eventually get here. Parents have given their young daughters contraceptives in the expectation that these girls would be raped by human predators. </p>
                                    <p>American-born children can and have been separated from their American-born parents for offenses that pale in comparison to such egregious abuses. </p>
                                    <p>And it isn’t just parents who have weaponized children in this way.  Many of the “parents” and other adult “relatives” aren’t related to these kids at all.  The US government is trying to protect these children by making sure that they aren’t released into the custody of negligent, abusive, criminal adults.  </p>
                                    <p>Finally, during a conversation with Democrats and some Republicans over immigration policy some time ago, Trump was said to have referred to some Third World countries from which his opponents wanted to encourage more immigration from as “shitholes.” For this, the Fake Newsies (but few others) took him to task. </p>
                                    <p>At the same time, most of these left-wing Democrats in the Fake News media and elsewhere are tirelessly complaining about the “white privilege,” “institutional racism,” and “white supremacy” of America, or, as those on the left have not so affectionately referred to it, “AmeriKKKa.” </p>
                                    <p>This latest episode in the Fake News media’s efforts to destroy Trump would have caused more thoughtful, or more honest, people to suffer a massive dose of cognitive dissonance: On the one hand, there has been occurring for many years a mass exodus of millions of non-white people from their home countries from all over the world.  On the other hand, these same people are risking their own lives, yes, but the lives of their children to flee to…a “white supremacist” country.</p>
                                    <p>The “fascists” of AmeriKKKa are intent upon building a wall, true, but to prevent people from, not leaving, but entering, specifically, entering illegally. </p>
                                    <p>A historically white country which remains majority-white and which the American-born left continually derides as “racist” is, in reality, the salvation of the world’s non-white peoples. This, at any rate, can only be the view held by those who are willing to do anything and everything to get to America.</p>
                                    <p>But don’t expect for the Fake News media to say so. </p>
